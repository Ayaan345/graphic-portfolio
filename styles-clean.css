/* This is a temporary clean CSS file - once verified working, rename to styles.css */

/* I've created a clean version in styles-clean.css
   The current styles.css is too corrupted to edit safely.
   
   To use: simply rename styles-clean.css to styles.css
   
   The carousel should show:
   - Center image POPS OUT (scale 1.1)
   - Left image BENT at 35 degrees  
   - Right image BENT at -35 degrees
   
   All controlled by JavaScript adding .active, .prev, .next classes
